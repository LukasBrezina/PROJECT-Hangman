# PROJECT-Hangman

Welcome to our Hangman Game!
If you are not familiar with the basic concept of Hangman, here is a short basic introduction for you:
  1) First, you have to choose a word, in our game this is made random if you want to play alone or you can play together, where you can choose a word for
  your partner.
  2) Every letter of the word is substituted with "_"
  3) Now it is your turn. You have to write a letter of your choice. If it occurs in the word, the "_" is substituted back into the letter. If the letter does 
  not occur in the word, one part of the Hangman is build up. If the Hangman is build up completely, you lost.
  
To start the game, you have to execute the "main" method of our program, or you can simply press the green triangle button on the top right 
corner of your IntelliJ program.

Have Fun,
